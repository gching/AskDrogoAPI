## Introduction

**A work in progress for Global Hackathon**

The *AskDrogo API* is the backend base of the AskDrogo application. AskDrogo is an application that provides accurate and real time translations for items such as text, speech and video. Imagine the possibilities of talking, real time, to the Dothraki without actually understanding their language!

## Why Drogo?
Why not? *Khal fines assoe mezhah jahakmeni vos khal.* I take no orders from no Khal.

## Structure

* Items (to be translated)

Items are the main meat (or steeds) of the AskDrogo API. An *item* stores the request (item to be translated)

* Dothraki (the answer.)

A possible response and translated solution to a given item. Voting results will also be stored here.
